# coproduct-factoring
Mathematica code for factoring tensor product expressions and manipulating coproducts and symbols.

The code in this repository is described with examples here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/vmjddgxbbwjw#4073bc

This is very much caveman code, and is not very well structured, but may contain some useful implementations. The above document is much cleaner, and likely easier to work with.
